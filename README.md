## What is this project about
Our idea is to have a drone that follows you while running for analysing your running technique and physique.

## Development Intructions
This project uses SCSS for its styles. Please make sure to write all your styles in the 'style.scss' file only.

### Basic Compilation
To compile your SCSS file into a CSS file, run:
`sass scss/your-style.scss css/your-style.css`
This will output the compiled CSS into your existing css/ directory.

### Automated Watching
For ongoing development, use the --watch flag to automatically compile SCSS files when they change:
`sass --watch scss/your-style.scss:css/your-style.css`
